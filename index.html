    <p class="wiki-desc">
      gulp.js is an open-source JavaScript toolkit by Fractal Innovations and the open
      source community at GitHub, used as a streaming build system in front-end web development.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is a task runner built on Node.js and npm, used for automation of time-consuming
      and repetitive tasks involved in web development like minification, concatenation,
      cache busting, unit testing, linting, optimization, etc.
    </p>
    <p>
      gulp uses a code-over-configuration approach to define its tasks and relies on its small,
      single-purposed plugins to carry them out. gulp ecosystem has 300+ such plugins
      made available to choose from.
